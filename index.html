            Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Dibya Ranjan Lenka and I am from Balasore, Odisha. I am a passionate and dedicated student at VSSUT Burla, eager to explore and
            innovate in the fields of technology and engineering. My journey includes expertise in C, C++, Python, HTML,
            CSS, JavaScript, and Arduino programming, along with hands-on experience in electronics and AI/ML. I am
            currently building projects, including a website for hackathon (TECHTRONIX) and a portfolio website, to showcase my skills. With a keen
            interest in problem-solving, I actively participate in coding challenges and hardware-based projects. This
            portfolio highlights my technical journey, achievements, and aspirations as I strive to contribute to the
            IEEE society and beyond.

            I have a strong understanding of HTML (90%), which helps me structure web pages effectively. My CSS skills
            are at an intermediate level (50%), so I can style my website but still have room for improvement.

            When it comes to JavaScript, I am just getting started (30%). I am learning how to add interactivity to my
            website and improve user experience. I also have a decent grasp of Python (50%) and use it for programming
            tasks.

            In terms of programming languages, I am highly proficient in C (90%) and have a solid understanding of C++
            (70%). These languages have helped me develop strong problem-solving and logical thinking skills.
